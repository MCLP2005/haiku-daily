Flakes dance on wind’s tune  
A ballet on the pavement  
Day ends in soft sighs

Under winter’s watchful eye  
Night cloaks humble hearts

Sky draped in granite  
Frosted clouds wander aimless  
Dreams shiver in blue

Rivers murmur in thaw’s grip  
Whispers coax the spring

Leap day in winter  
Time bends in a frozen arc  
Possibility blooms
