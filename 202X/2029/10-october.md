Subtle hues of gold,  
Drifting in the fading light,  
Nature sighs goodbye.

Moonlight casts long tales,  
Silhouetted dreams arise,  
Night whispers softly.

Last breeze of October,  
Nature speaks in hushed tones now,  
Leaves bid fond adieu.

Haunted winds echo,  
Costumes waltz with midnight air,  
A final autumn sigh.
