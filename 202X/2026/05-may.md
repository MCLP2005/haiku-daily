Across pages of morning  
Nature writes anew

Clouds drift, aimless, free  
Sketching stories on blue vast  
Day dreams without bounds

Early dew glistens  
Catching the face of sunlight  
Gems on nature’s cheek

Whispers of the wind  
Stir memories of lost dreams  
Time flows softly on

Sunset embers fall  
On a sky of fleeting gold  
Night’s promise awaits

Scent of wild jasmine  
Dances over gentle glens  
Hearts sing with the breeze

Lavender twilight  
Wraps the earth in calm repose  
Stars blink into life

A mighty oak stands  
Witness to a thousand suns  
Time etched in its bark  

May 26
The river murmurs  
Winding through vibrant meadows  
Journey of the day  

May 27
Gentle rain returns  
Each soft drop a note of joy  
Earth sighs in delight  

May 28
Moonlight on water  
Reflects the quiet daylight  
Night serenades calm  

May 29
Morning stirs anew  
Nature’s chorus wakes the dawn  
Day sings in soft light  

May 30
Tender sun ascends  
Warmth spills on each petal’s face  
Hope guides every breath

Final day of May  
A farewell in spring’s soft hues  
Dreams blossom once more
