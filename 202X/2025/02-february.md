**February 1**
Chill winds whisper low,  
Frost clings to the sleeping earth,  
Dreams of spring begin.  

**February 2**  
Groundhog sees his breath,   
Shadows dance on frozen ground,  
Winter holds its sway.  

**February 3**  
Icicles glisten,  
Sunlight breaks the frozen dawn,  
Hope drips with the thaw.  

**February 4**  
Silence of snowfall,  
Blanket wrapped in quiet grace,  
Heartbeat of winter.  

**February 5**  
Gray clouds part at last,  
Sun smiles on the cold, hard ground,  
Life beneath stirs slow.  

**February 6**  
Branches bare and bold,  
Sketch the sky with patient lines,  
Drawing spring anew.  

**February 7**  
Crimson ribbons flash,  
In the sky where cardinals sing,  
Joy in stark contrasts.  

**February 8**  
Midday light grows long,  
Breathing through shadows of snow,  
Promises linger.  

**February 9**  
A single crocus,  
Courage in the icy soil,  
Breaks winter's still spell.  

**February 10**  
Footprints on fresh snow,  
Stories of wandering souls,  
Traced then lost to warmth.  

**February 11**  
Twilight soft and cool,  
Stars begin their nightly watch,  
Guiding dreams to bloom.  

**February 12**  
Eaves drip softly now,  
Melodies of freeze retreat,  
Songs of coming spring.  

**February 13**  
Footsteps echo thin,  
On the street of winter's town,  
Yet warmth stirs within.  

**February 14**  
Hearts join, hands held close,  
In winter's embrace, love warms,  
Melting frost with care.  

**February 15**  
Morning's icy breath,  
Draws its art on window panes,  
Beauty in transition.  

**February 16**  
Whispers in the trees,  
Hints of buds soon bursting forth,  
Nature stirs awake.  

**February 17**  
Quiet streams unfreeze,  
Flowing free beneath the sun,  
Life's pulse quickens soft.  

**February 18**  
Veils of mist dissolve,  
Sunlight peeks through heavy clouds,  
Frost gives way to green.  

**February 19**  
Birds return to sing,  
Their chorus in dawn's cool light,  
Welcomes spring's approach.  

**February 20**  
Pine's scent rich and deep,  
Carried on the warming breeze,  
Winter's grip now wanes.  

**February 21**  
Patches of earth show,  
Through the snow's receding veil,  
Hints of rebirth shine.  

**February 22**  
Gentle rains descend,  
Washing away icy hold,  
Renewal begins.  

**February 23**  
Wind carries a tune,  
Notes of warmth on winter's edge,  
Heralds of springtime.  

**February 24**  
Bare trees soon will dress,  
In garments of green and bright,  
Cycle starts anew.  

**February 25**  
Clouds drift lazily,  
Soft shadows play on the land,  
Peace before the bloom.  

**February 26**   
Winter's end draws near,  
Tales and tears in melting snow,  
Life begins once more.  

**February 27**  
Sunrise brings new warmth,  
Awakening sleepy fields,  
Dreams of green arise.  

**February 28**  
Stillness breaks at last,  
Spring whispers from tomorrow,  
Winter says goodbye.
