Below is a series of thirty haiku—one for each day of April 2039. Each poem follows the classic 5–7–5 syllable structure and seeks to capture a small, shifting moment of spring’s magic:

gentle winds share soft secrets  
spring awakes in trust.

dew pearls rest on bright petals,  
dawn greets tender hope.
