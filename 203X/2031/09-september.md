Mid-month of a golden stretch,  
Leaves whirl like wishes.

Quiet murmurs through fallen leaves,  
Twentieth day reflects.

Silver dreams in night's deep calm,  
Twenty-one aglow.

A soft ballet on pavement,  
Nature’s tender notes.

Valleys draped in gauzy veils,  
Day twenty-three dreams.

In the hush of ancient woods,  
Twenty-four whispers.

Footprints trace a story new,  
Day twenty-five sings.

A silvery kiss on leaves,  
Twenty-six in still.

Revealing crisp autumn splendor,  
Day twenty-seven beams.

Whispers echo underfoot,  
Twenty-eight in calm.

Nature dons its final cloak,

Final verse of autumn’s song,  
September exhales.
