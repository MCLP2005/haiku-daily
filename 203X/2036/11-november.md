Fires softly flicker  
warming the chill of evening  
embers hold the night

Moon ascends its throne  
over frosted fields and boughs  
night cradles our dreams

Silver mists arise  
dawn repaints the barren skies  
time whispers softly

Frost etches windows  
crisp air sculpts a quiet grace  
twilight leans to sleep

Smoky horizon  
melds with the chill of long night  
midnight listens on  

Day 29  
Bare winter beckons  
under quilts of falling snow  
soft silence echoes  

Day 30  
November whispers  
closing chapters of autumn  
dawn awaits the cold
