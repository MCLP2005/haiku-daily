Soft sighs of lingering warmth  
Embrace early chill.

Murmuring creek waves,  
Glimmering under grey skies,  
Day drifts soft and slow.

Twilight’s silver kiss,  
Ancient oaks guard memories,  
A hush of autumn.

Early morning haze,  
A solitary sparrow  
Sings through cooling air.

Crimson clouds afloat,  
Summer's remnants now in dusk,  
Autumn finds its depth.

A timid sunrise,  
Smudges the dark, old regrets—  
Fresh ink on new dreams.

Every breath a chill,  
Cupped hands cradle morning’s hope,  
Light warms the dim earth.

Fungus and fallen  
Oak logs share the quiet load  
Of ancient seasons.

Dappled afternoon,  
Sunlight weaves through amber clouds,  
Nature’s quilt unfolds.

Bitter wind gliding,  
Carving patterns in the sky—  
Day sketches its art.

Drizzle on window,  
Echoes of a quiet rain,  
Leaves murmur their love.

Frost tips silent fields,  
A crisp page turned in the year,  
Autumn holds its breath.

Dusky, muted world,  
A single star peeks awake,  
Night pens modest dreams.

October 27  
Whispering shadows,  
Streetlamps cast mellow stories,  
Hope drifts in the dark.

October 28  
A cool, steady rain,  
Carving ribbons on pavement,  
Renewal begins.

October 29  
Early fog settles,  
Mystery floats on thin air,  
Day softens to gray.

October 30  
Amber daylight fades,  
Echoed laughter in the wind,  
Memories linger.

Halloween twilight,  
Pumpkin grins in misty dusk,  
Spirits dance in fall.
