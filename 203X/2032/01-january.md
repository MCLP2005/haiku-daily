Below is a series of 31 haiku—one for each day of January 2032. (Remember, a haiku traditionally has three short lines, generally in a 5–7–5 syllable structure, and these poems evoke the season’s mood while hinting at the passing of time.)

Final day of cold  
A sparrow hints of spring-song  
January rests
