Below is a series of 31 haikus—one for each day of March 2054. Each haiku, in the traditional three‐line form, aims to capture a fleeting moment of that future March day. (Note: While the classic Japanese haiku structure is 5–7–5 “on” or sound units, these English versions are meant to evoke the spirit rather than measure syllables exactly.)
