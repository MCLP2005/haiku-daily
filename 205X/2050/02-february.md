Journeys through the frost

Glimmer on frosted meadows  
Promise in each ray

Clouds drift like soft ghosts  
Over the winter’s canvas  
A calm, frozen sea

Icy blossoms form  
On shivering, bare branches  
Cold music resounds

Glacial reflections  
Mirrored in tranquil puddles  
Time holds breath in ice

A lone bird calls out  
Breaking the winter’s deep hush  
Voice on frozen air

Twilight paints soft hues  
Evening’s cool caress lingers  
Day fades into peace  

Day 28 –  
Last day, winter stills  
Fading frost with quiet hope  
February bows
