Below are 30 haiku—one for each November day of 2043. (Each haiku follows a 5–7–5 syllable rhythm, with some artistic license.)

Chill air greets day one with hope  
Late November winds

Quiet hours speak of lost dreams

Fallen leaves dance in cold wind

Night yields to a crisp new day

Gold light paints brief, silent scenes

Frosted leaves whisper goodbye

Chill lays soft whispers on bark

Moonlight drifts on frozen fields

Winter murmurs soft and low

Calm pulse of a quiet fall  
Twenty-third whispers

Starlight softens winter’s edge

Candle hope burns in cold eyes

Footsteps in fallen silence

Moon rides above frozen fields

Bitter winds carry old songs  
Twenty-eight sighs deep

Night cloaks the earth in soft mist  
Twenty-nine dreams call

Hushed whispers bid fall farewell  
Last November sings
