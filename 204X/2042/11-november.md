Crisp morning splendor,  
first chill in golden silence—  
November awakens.

Autumn’s quiet song,  
wind dancing with amber leaves—  
daybreak promises.

Sky brushed with cool blue,  
a lone crow calls through the mist—  
time drifts like falling.

Clouds wander slowly,  
echoes of future moments—  
earth cradles the now.

Rust and ochre fields,  
footsteps trace paths of seasons—  
daylight fades gently.

etched against a steely sky—

Silver rain softly,  
etching stories on windows—  
the day listens close.

Chilled light in transit,  
each falling leaf a memoir—  
time’s gentle cascade.

Melancholy hues,  
a reflective pause in time—  
quiet grit in fall.

A crisp, vibrant day,  
where every step feels surreal—  
future in the now.

Day 28  
Cobalt dusk descends,  
murmuring secrets of night—  
a hymn of renewal.

Fading light reveals  
the soft imprint of each day—  
autumn’s final brush.

Last day’s whispered note,  
gold and russet merge as one—  
November exhales.
