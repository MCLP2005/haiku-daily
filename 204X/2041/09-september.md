Below is a series of 30 haiku—one for each day of September 2041. (In the spirit of the traditional form, each haiku is three lines that capture a fleeting moment of nature and time. Enjoy this poetic journey through a future autumn.)

Final autumn note,  
September bows to winter,  
Stars crown silent hope.
